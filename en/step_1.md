## Introduction


You're going to learn programming by building a game with a language called Python.

**Did you know?**
Websites like YouTube and Instagram are built using Python.

### What you will make

You will make a guessing game in which the computer picks a number between 1 and 9, and the player has five chances to guess the number.
