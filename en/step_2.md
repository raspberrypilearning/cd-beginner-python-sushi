## What you will need

Youâ€™re going to need **Python**! You can either use Python online in a web browser, or download and install it on your computer. Select the right option for you below and follow the instructions.

+ Go to [repl.it](https://repl.it){:target="blank"} and type or search for Python3.

The editor looks like this:

On the left is where you write all your code. On the right is the console, where the code runs.

To run the code, you click the "Run" button.

+ If you want to save your projects, you can sign up for an account and log in.

Before you can start coding, you'll need to set up your computer to write Python. You'll need to have Python and a text editor installed, and know how to run a Python program.

+ To install Python, go to [dojo.soy/py-setup](http://dojo.soy/py-setup){:target="blank"} and click on the **Download Python 3** button. There will be some other numbers after the **3**, but they change too often for me to include them. Don't worry about them.

+ Once the installer has downloaded, start it and click through it, accepting the default choices.

+ Now you need to get a text editor, to write your Python in. We recommend Atom, which you can download from [http://atom.io](http://atom.io){:target="blank"}, but you can use another editor if you're more familiar with it. Or just like it better.

+ Once you have both of these set up, you're ready to go. You just need to make sure that everything is working and that you know how to run a Python program. Follow these steps:
 1. Make a new folder for your Python Sushi Cards projects.
 2. Open your text editor and create a new file. Save it into the folder you just made and call it **beginner_sushi.py**.
 3. Open the command line on your computer (called **command prompt** on Windows and **Terminal** on Mac) and navigate to your folder using the `cd` command.
 4. Once you've opened your folder in the command line, you're ready to try running this blank file with this command, entered into the command line:
  ```bash
  python3 beginner_sushi.py
  ```
  If this has worked, you shouldn't see any messages when you run the command.

### Running a program
In later cards, you'll be asked to **run** a program.   
What that means is what you've just done: getting to the folder that has the program file in it and using the **python3** command and its name to make the program do its thing!
